# JavaScript Dice game

This game allows each player to throw a virtual dice as many times as they want. Each dice throw is added to a current score. At any point the player can press the hold button to add the current score to their full score and give the other player a turn. If a player gets a 1 from the dice the player will loose the current score and it will be the next players turn. The game is won by the player that reaches 100 points first.
